I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Dartmouth College, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Soroush Vosoughi](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/people/soroush-vosoughi). My research interests lie in natural language processing, machine learning, interpretability, and the simulation of large language models.

Before enrolling at Dartmouth, I worked as a research assistant with Prof. Vosoughi for a year, focusing on the interpretability of language models. I hold a B.S. in Information Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), with a minor in Applied Mathematics.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a strong appreciation for logic-based puzzle games that emphasize mathematical reasoning, such as Sudoku. I am also deeply passionate about traditional Chinese culture and artsâ€”I play the pipa, specialize in Chinese calligraphy, and previously served as the president of the SJTU Calligraphy, Painting and Seal Cutting Association.
